# Example Code from Externship

This repository contains code that I completed during a recent externship program.  
The purpose of this repository is to provide example code samples for **application and demonstration purposes only**.  

## About
- The code in this repository reflects work done as part of hands-on learning and project-based assignments.  
- It is not a full production-ready project, but rather selected pieces that highlight my coding style, problem-solving approach, and ability to work with different tools and technologies.  

## Usage
- This code is provided as an **example only**.  
- It is not intended for direct use in production environments.  

## Notes
- Some files may be incomplete or simplified versions of larger projects.  
- Certain details (such as project setup or private dependencies) may have been removed to keep this repository lightweight.
